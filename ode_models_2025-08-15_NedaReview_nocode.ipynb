    "This model tracks the number and total volume of each cell type in the developing neuroblast (NB) lineage, under an adder-based division rule. Division rates are volume-added–dependent: a cell divides only after adding a fixed volume ΔV to its birth size. Unlike the birth-volume–scaled adder model, there is no feedback from NB birth size to NB growth rate — all NBs grow at the same constant per-cell rate regardless of size at birth.\n",
